defmodule Commanded.ProcessManagers.ProcessManager do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour to define a process manager.

  A process manager is responsible for coordinating one or more aggregate roots.
  It handles events and dispatches commands in response.
  Process managers have state that can be used to track which aggregate roots are being orchestrated.

  Use the `Commanded.ProcessManagers.ProcessManager` macro in your process manager module and implement the three callback functions defined in the behaviour:

  - `c:interested?/1`
  - `c:handle/2`
  - `c:apply/2`

  ## Example

      defmodule ExampleProcessManager do
        use Commanded.ProcessManagers.ProcessManager,
          name: "ExampleProcessManager",
          router: BankRouter

        def interested?(%AnEvent{...}) do
          # ...
        end

        def handle(%ExampleProcessManager{...}, %AnEvent{...}) do
          # ...
        end

        def apply(%ExampleProcessManager{...}, %AnEvent{...}) do
          # ...
        end
      end

  Start the process manager (or configure as a worker inside a [Supervisor](supervision.html))

      {:ok, process_manager} = ExampleProcessManager.start_link()

  Please read the [Process managers](process-managers.html) guide for more details.

  Is the process manager interested in the given command?

  The `c:interested?/1` function is used to indicate which events the process manager receives.
  The response is used to route the event to an existing instance or start a new process instance.

  - Return `{:start, process_uuid}` to create a new instance of the process manager.
  - Return `{:continue, process_uuid}` to continue execution of an existing process manager.
  - Return `{:stop, process_uuid}` to stop an existing process manager and shutdown its process.
  - Return `false` to ignore the event.

  A `c:handle/2` function must exist for each `:start` and `:continue` tagged event previously specified.
